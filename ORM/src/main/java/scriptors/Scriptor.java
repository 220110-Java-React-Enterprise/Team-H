    //start from having some plain old POJO just for development
    //write the SQL scripts necessary to CRUD, for instance here's a basic Read script:
    String sql = "SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ?";

    String firstPart = "SELECT * FROM ";
    String tablename = "";        //reflect on the object to get this
    String nextPart = " WHERE ";
    String filterColumn = "";     //reflect upon the object for this data as well
    String parameterList = " = ?";

    //now we have our script and just need to build it:
    String script = firstPart + tablename + nextPart + filterColumn + parameterList;

    //now we can create the preparesstatement and parameterize it. In face we don;t even need to parameterize it here,
    //I prefer to hand the pstmt back in the return value of the script method, and go from there -Kyle
